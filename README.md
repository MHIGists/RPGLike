## Usage

<div id="usage">
Aftrer installation and initial start you can check the plugin data folder of the plugin<br>
to configure the plugin to your liking.<br>

###messages.yml:<br>
Here you can change every string that's displayed to the player.
###players.yml
Here are all the players that've connected to the server with all their attributes.
###config.yml
Here are all the settings of the plugin. Here is a quick rundown of the settings you'll need.<br>
####keep-xp:<br>
Pretty self-explanatory this setting has 2 values. true or false. Controls whether the player<br>
loses all attributes,skills,traits and levels when they've died.
####discovery:
This setting has 2 values true or false. When set to true it will hide every skill and trait until the<br>
player have unlocked it.<br>
When set to false all skills and traits will be visible in the /rpg menu.
####Hud
Here you can turn on or off the included HUD. Change the message it transmits, its period in which its transmitted<br>
and the timezone of the server.
####Skills
Here are all the skills the plugin has. Here is the Tank skills for example.<br>
If you look at [levels]() you will see under it all the available levels for this particular skill.<br>
You are free to add new levels to your liking. Just be sure to keep the spacing of it. As a hint you can copy level 2<br>
place it right under it. From there you can simply change 2 => 3 and change its values. Now here are the values<br>
under [unlock]() you have first the Attribute (VIT,DEX,STR or DEF) you can freely change this as you like. <br>
on the right of the Attribute you have the points a player must have in order to unlock it. If you want to add more<br>
Attributes to unlock a skill just add a new line under unlock with the next requirement in the format [Attribute]() : [Points]()<br>
Under [unlock]() you have [chance]() from there you can configure the chance at which a skill's effect will trigger itself.<br>
<br>
That about explains the [levels]() the next one is [range]() when an active or passive skill has AOE range this is where<br>
it's configured. The value is in blocks from the source player.<br>
<br>
[max_entities_in_range]() this option allows to set the maximum entities in the [range]() of the skill that will be affected<br>
by the effect of the skill. The value is an integer.<br>
<br>
[is_aoe]() controls whether the skills is aoe or not. If this option is set to true please specify [range]() and [max_entities_in_range]()
<br>
[cooldown]() controls the cooldown of an active ability it's value is an integer in seconds<br>
<br>
[is_active]() has 2 values true and false, when set to true the skill is considered active and should have a [cooldown]().<br>
<br>

####Modifiers
Those are used to modify how much a player gains per point in an attribute. For example DEX with a value of 0.005 will be multiplied by the points in DEX.
Try experimenting with these to achieve the desired strength of attributes.
